# Netlify Deployment Instructions

## Fixed Configuration

The deployment issue has been resolved by:

1. Updating the `netlify.toml` file to use the correct build command:
   ```
   npm install && npm run build
   ```

2. Ensuring the `package.json` has all necessary dependencies:
   - React and React DOM
   - TypeScript and type definitions
   - UI components (Radix UI, etc.)
   - Build tools (Vite, etc.)

3. Including all required configuration files:
   - `tsconfig.json` and `tsconfig.node.json` for TypeScript
   - `postcss.config.js` and `tailwind.config.js` for styling

## Deployment Steps

1. Push all changes to GitHub
2. In Netlify, ensure:
   - Base directory is set to `client`
   - Build command is `npm install && npm run build`
   - Publish directory is `dist`
   - NODE_VERSION environment variable is set to 18

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter build issues:
1. Check the build logs for specific errors
2. Verify all dependencies are in package.json
3. Make sure all required configuration files are present and correctly formatted
4. Test the build locally before deploying

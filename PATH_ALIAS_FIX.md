# Path Alias Resolution Fix for Netlify Deployment

This document explains the fix for the Rollup error encountered during Netlify deployment.

## The Issue

The build was failing with the following error:
```
[vite]: Rollup failed to resolve import "@/components/ui/toaster" from "/opt/build/repo/client/src/App.tsx".
```

This occurred because Vite wasn't properly configured to resolve the `@/` path alias used throughout the project.

## The Solution

### 1. Updated Vite Configuration

The `vite.config.ts` file was updated to include the path alias configuration:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';
import path from 'path';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  build: {
    outDir: 'dist',
  },
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      '@': path.resolve(__dirname, './src'),
    },
  },
  server: {
    // ...existing server config
  },
});
```

This tells Vite to resolve imports starting with `@/` to the `src` directory of your project.

### 2. Updated Netlify Build Command

The `netlify.toml` file was updated to ensure the path module is installed:

```toml
[build]
  publish = "dist"
  command = "npm install path && npm install && npm run build"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"
```

## Why This Fixes the Issue

1. **Path Resolution**: The `resolve.alias` configuration in Vite maps the `@/` prefix to your source directory, allowing imports like `@/components/ui/toaster` to be correctly resolved.

2. **Path Module**: Adding the path module ensures that the `path.resolve()` function works correctly in the Netlify build environment.

## Prevention for Future Issues

When using path aliases in your project:

1. Always ensure your build tool (Vite, Webpack, etc.) is configured to resolve these aliases.
2. Make sure both TypeScript (tsconfig.json) and your build tool have matching path alias configurations.
3. Test builds locally before deploying to catch path resolution issues early.

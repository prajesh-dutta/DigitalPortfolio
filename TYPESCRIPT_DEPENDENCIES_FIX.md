# Fixed TypeScript Dependencies for Netlify Deployment

This guide addresses the specific TypeScript errors encountered during the Netlify deployment.

## The Issue

The build was failing because:

1. Missing dependencies for UI components and libraries:
   - framer-motion
   - three.js
   - Radix UI components
   - React Hook Form
   - Zod
   - And many others

2. Missing TypeScript type declarations for these libraries.

## Fixed Package.json

The updated package.json now includes:

1. All the required UI component libraries
2. Animation libraries (framer-motion)
3. 3D rendering libraries (three.js)
4. Form handling libraries (react-hook-form, zod)
5. TypeScript type declarations

## Fixed TypeScript Configuration

The tsconfig.json and tsconfig.node.json files have been updated to:

1. Enable proper module resolution
2. Add esModuleInterop to improve compatibility with non-TS modules
3. Relax some strict type checking for UI components that rely on implicit types

## How to Deploy Successfully

1. Use the updated package.json with all dependencies
2. Use the updated tsconfig.json and tsconfig.node.json
3. Push all changes to GitHub
4. Trigger a new deployment on Netlify

## Notes for Future Development

When adding new UI components or libraries, always remember to:

1. Add both the library and its TypeScript types to package.json
2. Run a local TypeScript check (npx tsc --noEmit) before deploying
3. Consider running a local build test (npm run build) to catch issues early
